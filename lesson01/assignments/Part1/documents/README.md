# Course Project Proposal 

## Proposal
I want to build a website that allows users to open their foodie horizons. This past year, my partner and I have become more interested in cooking easy and delicious meals at home. I want this site to be a place where we can showcase our favorite recipes and pictures, as well as a resource for visitors to search for new recipes. In short, I want users to be able to: 

* view and interact with an existing recipe collection
* search for new recipes based on ingredients they have on-hand
* search for recipes based on food allergies
* view an ingredient list for a specific recipe
* analyze estimated cost per recipe 

## API 
To accomplish these objectives, I plan to utilize the Spoonacular Recipe - Food - Nutrition API. The capabilities of this API can be found here: https://rapidapi.com/spoonacular/api/recipe-food-nutrition.
