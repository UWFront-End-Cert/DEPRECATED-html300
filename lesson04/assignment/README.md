### Research

### To get started:
-	In your forked repo, create a new branch called `lesson-04` or something like that
-   Navigate to the root folder of this assignment within terminal in your fork, `lesson04/assignment`
-   Run `npm install`
-   Run `gulp`
- 	Work in the same setup as you're used to, feel free to structure the SCSS at your preference
- 	Make sure that your code runs and the animation works in the browser when finished

### Requirements:
- CSS Animation(s) present is based on transitioning properties, should look smooth
- Use of Sass features (at least 1 mixin and variables)
