# Assignment 10 - SEO

The main focus of the final week will be working on completing assignment09/the course project. As a supplement, you'll learn about SEO best practices, write a proposal in your course project repo's `documents` folder as to your ideal SEO implementation, and configure the SEO on your global `nuxt.config.js` and Nuxt pages using the `head` method in your page's `<script>`.

### To get started:
-	Remember, the course project's repo is where we are working on the final submission. 
-	In the `documents` folder you created, create a `.md` file and include within what you learned about SEO & analytics (1-2 paragraphs).
-	Include another section with how you would ideally implement SEO on your site (for our purposes we will add some light metadata -- this would be if you had plenty of time to fully implement the metadata that you'd like)
-	Check out the above links on `nuxt.config.js` and the `head` method.
-	Your `nuxt-config.js` file should have some metadata in it already, modify that to include your site's fallback (default) metadata.
-	Within your `pages`, add the `head` method to the `<script>`, and then include the `hid` meta line to overwrite the description on a page-by-page basis
-	**Bonus** Add any additional metadata that you'd like


### To Submit:
- 	Review the requirements in the rubric on Canvas
- 	Submit the link to your course project repo as well as the live site's Netlify link in Canvas (same submission as lesson09)
