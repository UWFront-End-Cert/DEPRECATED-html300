What I learned:
Effective SEO optimization, social integration, and analytics are key to driving user adoption and engagement.  SEO and Social help get the site discovered for free, with paid media being the next level of acquiring users.  Analytics on the page, really help understand the behaviour of your users and places to look at improving your UI, content,etc.


For my site - social and easy SEO ptimization is key - it would be a location where hopefully a community forms through posting and sharing trip reports - so first the users need to discover the site, start engaging and hopefully generate that community growth through social engagement.  Additonally, once users start visting the site - using analytics will help understand what on the site is working and what isn't.
