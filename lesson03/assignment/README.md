# Assignment 03 - JSON & Objects

### To get started:

-   Navigate to the root folder of this assignment within terminal
-   Run `npm install`
-   Run `gulp`
-   Start working with the files, browsersync will watch your scss/HTML files and reload on changes
- 	Use the contents of `data/data.json` for your data
- 	Migrate your previous SCSS/HTML from assignment 2 for your component
- 	In your JS, convert the component to a template and loop through the JSON data, creating components for each object in the data
- 	Output the templated data onto the `.template-hook` section of the index.html page
- 	*BONUS*: Add to your component another section for the `extras` key in the data. Loop through the `extras` array and add the contents to your new section in the component
