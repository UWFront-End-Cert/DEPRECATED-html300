# Activity 09 - API Fetching with Axios & Nuxt

We will be using Nuxt and Axios to pull from an API and populate a page with Card components using dynamic data.

### Vue References
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

### To get started:
-	 Watch the video on Nuxt to learn more about the framework, but for this activity you'll only need to work in two files.
-	 Verify `yarn` is installed by running `yarn -v` in your terminal to see if a version comes back
-	 Run `yarn` to install, verify packages installed successfully
-	 Run `yarn dev` to launch the local server
-	 Use Axios to fetch data from the [restcountries.eu](https://restcountries.eu/#api-endpoints-region) endpoint
-	 Americas was used in the video, try Europe `https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/region/europe`
-	 Create a Card component that includes the country's flag with alt/src, a heading with the country's name, and a p with the subregion.
-	 Import the Card into your `pages/index.vue` file and create a v-for loop to print each country
