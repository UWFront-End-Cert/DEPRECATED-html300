## Why I Chose This Subject
  I want to build this project to serve as a portfolio that showcases my technical skills, while including my own personal brand that highlights my soft skills, what I would offer as a team member, and my past successes that incorporate how I would translate my old skills into new.

### API
The API I plan to include is Goodreads. Personally, I am an avid reader. Including this API will allow users to search for books to read easily.

Some items to include in the project moving forward:

Personal Vision Statement
To acheive success as a front-end web developer, working well in a team, inspiring others, and contributing to my own community is important. I will do this by drawing on past experiences in executing a week-long fully fucntioning guest schedule for a Masters Week(R) guest house to be used by five team members; spearheading the inaugural Sustainable Hospitality Development Symposium on an accelerated timeline [link](https://csumb.edu/hospitality/sustainable-hospitality-development-symposium); and inspiring my community as a board member for the Augusta Handmade Fair and SFRG Treasurer.
Accordingly, I will focus on continous professional learning and growth.
