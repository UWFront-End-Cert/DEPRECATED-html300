# Lesson 05 - Flexbox Activity

We will be building out a flexbox header component with navigation and logo/CTA buttons.

### Required setup if not already installed (it should be)
- Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)
- [Design Spec Link](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/84967999-db5b-4e8a-7b25-95d59dcf02d7-f2a7/) (Doesn't require download/install of XD)

### To get started:
- 	Fetch from the upstream master and merge with your local master as we start each lesson
-	In your forked repo, create a new branch called `lesson-05` or something like that for the week
-   Navigate to the root folder of this assignment within terminal in your fork, `lesson05/activity`
-   Run `npm install`
-   Run `gulp`
-   Start working with the files, browsersync will watch your scss/HTML files and reload on changes
- 	Find the XD/PNG of the mockup component in the `ref` folder, see the design specs link above.
- 	Please keep using SCSS and BEM when building components/layouts
-   Given the XD design file/design specs link for the nav, use Flexbox to align the content within the header
-   The Logo & LogIn buttons should remain on the far left and right edges of the nav, respectively
-   The center main page buttons should stay centered within the nav
-   Below `768px` wide the logo/login buttons should be on top and bottom of the main page buttons, while the page buttons remain centered between
