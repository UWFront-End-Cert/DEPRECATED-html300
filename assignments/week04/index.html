    <h1>Farmers' Markets</h1>
    <h2>(read below there is a quiz at the end)</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Farmers' markets have been around for a long as we have been around, from the earliest civilizations to modern times</p>
    <p>Markets can be found in the smallest rural area to the largest and most populated cities</p>
    <p>And they can be found all over the globe.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>The concept of a "farmers' market" can be misleading.  They are not limited to products produced on farms or sold by farmers, rather some markets have almost every imaginable item for sale</p>
    <p>In some places, these markets can take up city blocks and can be larger than an Amazon warehouse</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Of course, Washington has it fair share of markets all over the state and in some communities there are several local markets</p>
    <p>And, I am sure that the most known and world-famous Washington market can be found in Seattle. It is known as the Pike Place Market</p>
