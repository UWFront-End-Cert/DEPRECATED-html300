Course Project Description
For my course project this quarter I'd like to build a restaurant website. I love food (who doesn't) but am constantly annoyed by the low quality websites that dominate this space. This is unfortunate given the opportunity for outstanding sites that are visually appealing
but also convenient and easy to use (responsiveness is key here: how often do we look
up restaurants in the moment when we're out and hungry). Poor websites
do restaurants a disservice; some would be unwilling to try them if the menu is pdf and hard to
access on mobile, for example. Worse, small restaurants may not have budget or know how to
tap into online ordering apps and aggregators to expand their reach through these services.
Many times these poor sites reflect restaurants with amazing food, and that's a shame!
I may pick such a place with a terrible site and attempt to rehash it or just make
something up.

From an initial search, there are a few different ways to integrate APIs:

Online ordering and ordering aggregators:
This is the most obvious but may be difficult to
do for this course since many don't appear to be free (also may not be worth integrating for fake data?). SplickIt, GloriaFood, Zomato

Location: Google Maps

Social: Juicer, FB for developers, Twitter API
