Website Proposal : Cooking Website
********************************************************************************

The website is going to be a cooking website, which will provide healthier recipes to its viewer for their unique food preferences. Along with recipes, I may include video recipes if API allows. I also want to include some blog post which is related to healthy lifestyle and diets.
My main page will have search tab for searching a recipe. It will also contains some recipes thumbnail in grid format. There will be few more pages related to recipes, blogs and contact details. The website will be responsive with different screen size.
Currently I am planning to use API from
  1. https://developer.yummly.com/
  2. https://developer.edamam.com/
I may use single API or may integrate recipes from websites if it supports.

User Profile:
---------------
Age Group for this website can range from 18 to 70 years.
Target Users can be beginner cook or professional, looking for new recipes.
Users may prefer to view recipe on mobile because it's easier to use them in kitchen.
